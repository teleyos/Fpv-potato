# FPV Potato
Born from the frustration of not being able to fpv drone in my minecraft world and the ram usage of Liftoff, i made this toy project to be able to fpv around in any world.

## Godot 4
Very easy to use and crossplatform so fairly easy to make the project

##Â Code quality
I went for usable instead of beautiful but feel free to fork it and improve it !

## Config
Here is the config i like to use:

```cfg
[drone]

thrust=1000.0
angular_thrust=60.0
gravity_value=-200.0
drag=0.2
spawn_transform=Transform3D(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0.926005, -2.0828, 4.26574, 4.62471)

[camera]

fov=80.0

```
